Open Jazdów is both the name of community and actions undertaken in Jazdów settlement in Warsaw, just behind The Ujazdowski Public Garden. After The Second World War, the colony of Finnish houses, that were constructed here, served as residential area for workers of Warsaw Reconstruction Bureau. 

Nowadays, Open Jazdów splits together residential and public functions. In 27 wooden houses and the adjacent gardens live and act next to each other: residents, non-governmental organizations, urban gardeners and beekeepers, academics and students, artists and workers of businesses, cooperatives, embassies and public institutions.

Our mission is to mix and match different groups to commonly develop public space, to create social and cultural program available to everyone, to practice alternative models of financing and sharing, to cultivate the gardens and just to hang well.
