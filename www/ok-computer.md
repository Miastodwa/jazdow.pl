This post serves as a little guide to the newer fast.ai students. The MOOC’s third iteration goes live in Jan ‘19.

This post summarises the mistakes that I had made when getting started, hopefully, this will help you avoid making the same when doing fast.ai or even getting started with any Deep Learning Course.
