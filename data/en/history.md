    text: 'Thanks to our efforts, the competition for projects in the Finnish houses
        was concluded as a partnership between the community and the district and city
        offices. As the community side, we had 5 judges in the jury, who had 4 out of
        9 votes in total. We modified the competition format: the organizations who applied
        in the com¬petition could meet before the verdict and join forces to enhan¬ce
        their chances and make better use of the possibilities, which using a house gave
        them. [Map of current hosts](/en/map/).'

        On June 11th, 2013 the Council of the City of Warsaw passed a bill according to which social consultations may be held at the request of the citizens of Warsaw signed by at least 1,000 people. Already in September that year, the Association of the Dwellers of the Finnish Houses in Jazdów made use of that opportunity and, with the help of Open Jazdów, issued a request for social consultations with regard to the settlement area signed by more than 2,000 people. The Town Hall accepted that request and started the social con¬sultation process aimed at creating a social concept of the space plan for the Jazdów settlement.

    date: 2011-2013
    text: A heated debate about the Jazdów Settlement was held in the years 2011- 2013.
        The citizens battled to save this place from totally disappearing from the map
        of Warsaw. The Sródmiescie district government decided to dedica¬te the area for
        commercial purposes and public amenities. However, the dwellers and urban activists
        created the Open Jazdów initiative to defend the historic settlement and houses,
        which survived till that day. The Ambassador of Fin¬land joined the ranks of defenders.

        forced to give to the USSR. Donated by the Soviet Union to Poland, the houses
        were constructed throughout the country. The Jazdów Settlement consisted of 90
        houses and was planned as a temporary solution.
